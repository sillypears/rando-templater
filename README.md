# Another dumb idea

The overlay image (your template) should have the outside of it filled in with some color, with the sculpt itself transparent. That means you need a PNG or something similar. Cool.

## v2
v2 is optimized for breaking the template into layers. Fill each layer in with black on the outside of the template. The overlay should be filled in white to the edges.
